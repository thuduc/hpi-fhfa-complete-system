# Implementation Status

## Completed Phases (4 of 7)

### Phase 1: Data Models & Validation ✅
- **Transaction Models**: TransactionPair with validation and quality filters
- **Geographic Models**: Tract, CBSA, and Supertract classes
- **Weight Models**: All 6 weight types (Sample, Value, Unit, UPB, College, Non-White)
- **Validators**: Comprehensive validation with FHFA quality control filters

### Phase 2: Data Generation & Loading ✅
- **Synthetic Data Generator**: Realistic housing transactions 1975-2023
- **Geographic Generator**: Tract geometries and CBSA relationships
- **Data Loader/Transformer**: I/O and transformation utilities
- **Test Data**: Generated sample datasets for testing

### Phase 3: Core Algorithms ✅
- **Repeat-Sales Regression**: Bailey-Muth-Nourse methodology implementation
- **Supertract Construction**: Dynamic aggregation for sparse data areas
- **BMN Index Estimator**: Complete pipeline with geographic aggregation
- **Sparse Matrix Operations**: Efficient computation for large datasets

### Phase 4: Weighting & Aggregation ✅
- **Demographic Weight Calculators**: All 6 weight types with demographic data support
- **Laspeyres Index**: Value-weighted index calculation with base period flexibility
- **Geographic Aggregator**: Multi-level aggregation (tract → CBSA → national)
- **Weight Normalizer**: Validation, normalization, and adjustment utilities

## Test Coverage

- **Overall Coverage**: 80%+ (exceeds target)
- **Core Models**: 90%+ coverage
- **Data Generation**: 98% coverage
- **Algorithms**: 95%+ coverage
- **Weighting**: 100% coverage (53 tests)
- **All Tests Passing**: 116 tests total

## Generated Test Data

Small test dataset created in `data/test_small/`:
- 5 CBSAs
- 50 Census tracts
- 500 Properties
- 750 Transactions
- 250 Repeat-sales pairs
- 11 years of data (2010-2020)
- 84% validation rate

## Next Steps

Ready to implement Phase 5: Outlier Detection & Robustness
- Outlier detection algorithms (Cook's distance, leverage)
- Robust regression techniques
- Data quality metrics and reporting
- Sensitivity analysis tools
